      "This is a project I made to share with the Reddit WoW community.  What this app does is it calls Raider.io API and returns a page count (a rankings of all characters who have completed a mythic+ dungeon).  The main challenge in making this app is that every week there is a different endpoint to call (twelve total).  I had to create a backend that would know which endpoint to call and save that data to a database. The API call would also need to be automated using AWS. Working on this project taught me a lot about using JS array methods (map, sort, filter, findIndex), and chaining Lodash functions (_.map, _.groupBy, _.sumBy).  I also learned to use TypeScript with React, and learn how to write my own React custom hook.",

I also added a login screen connected to Firebase.  I made the current page simply from flipping tabs between the real Twitter and then playing around with the CSS until I got a close enough match. Everytime I learned something new I would apply that knowledge to this project (such as adding Redux and Firebase Authentication).",

Similar to Trello, users can create a task, assign it to team members, drag and drop to any of the four categories (In Progress, Backlog, onHold, Completed).  On the project view, there is websocket for teams to message each other. The backend is Express.js with PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku.  On Github, you can read more about our planning on Figma, user stories and the ERD we made ðŸ˜Š.",

      "This was a midterm project that I made as a group at coding bootcamp.  It uses external APIs (Wolfram Alpha, OMDB, Yelp, Google Books) to auto assign a keyword to a specific category.  The main difficulty of this app is deciding which API's to use and then figuring out which order to chain the API calls.  On top of that there is some logic using Regexp that matches a keyword based on a specific verb (buy, eat, watch, read).  We made this project as a group of three after five weeks into coding bootcamp.",
