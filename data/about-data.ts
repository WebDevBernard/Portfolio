  "I am a software engineer focused on frontend web development.  Before transitioning to web development, I worked various jobs in customer service, with my most recent job as a Realtor.  My earliest experience working with code was a course I took in university on Visual Basic.   I regretfully did not pursue it further even though I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect.",

  "Last year I did a coding bootcamp, I learned about React, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL.  For my capstone project, our group make a Trello clone.  What I learned from that experience was how much fun I had with the design part of web development.  It reminded me a lot of my experience designing feature sheets as a Realtor.",

  "After bootcamp, I wanted to invest more time learning React and frontend development in general.  I have been doing a combination of Udemy courses and working on my own personal projects.  I really enjoyed making these apps and would welcome any feedback on how I could improve my code.",
